# Reddit Posts Project

## Overview

This is a simple reddit project. By searching posts are provided for the corresponding searchterm. 3 Basic subreddits are provided but you can add your own custom ones. If you click on one the posts gets filtered to the chosen subreddit. On mobile devices subreddits are provided below the posts.

## Wireframes

It only consists of a main page with a searchbar at the top. Below there are posts on the left and you can choose subreddits on the right.
On mobile the subreddits are below the posts.

## Technologies Used

I have built this project using react and redux. 
I used the following API: https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=${encodeURIComponent(inputValue)}.

## Future Work

I might get a custom domain name and deploy the site there.
